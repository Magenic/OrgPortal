Contributing to OrgPortal
=========
The OrgPortal project is open to contributions via pull request.

Before contributing it is important that you understand that you **must** have clear ownership of your contribution, and that by submitting a pull request you are granting Magenic the right to use your contribution to OrgPortal in any way we see fit under the terms of the OrgPortal license.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Add your idea to the issue list and engage in discussion of the idea *prior to doing serious work*. We love quality contributions, but are under no obligation to accept contributions we feel don't move the project in the right direction
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch. Releases are typically in maintenance mode and accept only
    critical bug fixes. Check with the project owners before working on
    anything other than critical bug fixes.
  * Create a branch in which to do your work.  Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
